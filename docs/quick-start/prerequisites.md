# Prerequisites

Tools and skills needed for developing ODE applications.

## Test Instance

To build your own application using ODE, you will need an instance set up for testing. You can set up a local instance by following the [local setup instructions](/docs/quick-start/deploy-local-instance).

## Build Tools

The build tools for ODE applications include:

- **Synkronus CLI**: Command-line interface for managing and deploying applications
- **Node.js**: For building custom applications
- **Docker**: For running local Synkronus instances

## Required Skills

Building an ODE application requires a technical skillset.

### To Build an App

- Use of command line tools to compile and deploy configuration code
- JSON Schema for building forms
- JSON Forms UI Schema for form layouts
- JavaScript/TypeScript for custom applications
- React for custom application development

### To Deploy an App

- System administration
- Database administration for PostgreSQL
- Familiarity with Docker
- Service monitoring
- Use of command line tools

## Configuration Skills

ODE applications consist of JSON files, form schemas, custom applications, and translations. The following technical skills are necessary:

### JSON Schema

Forms in ODE are defined using JSON Schema. Understanding JSON Schema is essential for building forms.

### JSON Forms

Form layouts are defined using JSON Forms UI Schema. Familiarity with JSON Forms is important for creating user interfaces.

### JavaScript/TypeScript

Custom applications are built using JavaScript or TypeScript. A good understanding of these languages is required for building custom applications.

### PostgreSQL

ODE uses PostgreSQL for data storage. Familiarity with SQL and PostgreSQL is useful for data management and analytics.
