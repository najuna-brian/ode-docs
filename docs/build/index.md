# Build

Build ODE applications and forms.

## Overview

This section provides guides for building ODE applications, creating forms, and managing data.

ODE applications are built using JSON Schema for form definitions, JSON Forms for UI layouts, and custom web applications that integrate with the ODE platform. All ODE applications share the same foundation, providing consistent capabilities across different implementations.
